# CSV-query

## Overview
Fetch a CSV and use Javascript and HTML to do a simple query of the data by passing a key and returning a value. In this case, passing a ZIP code value and returning a time value.

## How it works
A CSV with multiple key value pairs is located in the same folder as the index.html. Within the index.html file we have an embedded Javascript, where all the magic happens.

## Example
